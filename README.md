# Security Audit Lab

## 📝 Project Overview
As part of my Cybersecurity training, I conducted a simulated audit in a company environment to assess its compliance with core security requirements. The goal was to evaluate infrastructure, internal systems, policies, and employee access controls.

This lab was structured using a customized checklist inspired by NIST standards and PCI DSS best practices.
